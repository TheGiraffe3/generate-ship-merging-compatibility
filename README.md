This repository automatically generates a compatibility plugin between [ship.merging](https://github.com/zuckung/endless-sky-plugins/blob/main/README.md#shipmerging) and another plugin of your choice.<br>
To use it, open an issue and provide the owner-name/repository-name of the other plugin repository. Example: MidnightPlugins/Lost-in-Midnight<br>
The script will close your issue when the compatibility plugin is generated.<br>
You can do the same thing yourself locally with zuckung's script if you want. It can be found [here](https://github.com/zuckung/endless-sky-plugins/blob/main/tools/ES_plugin_script_ship_merging/ES_plugin_script_ship_merging.py).<br>
