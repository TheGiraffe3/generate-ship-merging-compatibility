        Welcome to the Compatibility Plugin Generation Request form.

        Change the field to the owner/repository you want to turn into a plugin (e.g. MidnightPlugins/Lost-in-Midnight, TheGiraffe3/rumskib).

        The repository must exist on GitHub, or the script will not work.

        If you want compatibility with a multi-plugin repo, enter the path to the plugin as well (e.g. Nova1422/plugins/myplugins/obtainheron)
